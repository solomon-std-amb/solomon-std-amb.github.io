Have you ever tried searching for how an AI works, but were dazzled by so many mathematical symbols and seemingly
dark magic? Don't panic! One of our beloved committee members has prepared some powerpoint slides demonstrating a
(grossly simplified) explanation of the backbone of Artificial Intelligence. Do note however that it is not in any
way comprehensive: There is still a lot of information we left out to be gained! Use this presentation as a jumping
board for more in-depth searches, not as an authority of information itself.

Have you ever wondered how Minecraft generates its diverse landscapes and biomes? Well, it turns out the answer
is something called Perlin Noise. As you may soon discover, Perlin Noise isn't confined to generating terrain-
It can produce a variety of other interesting effects as well! The following program demonstration tries to
implement some of those effects, and speculates on how Minecraft might generate its biomes.

The following are some games made by one of our committee members. None of them use very complicated logic,
but it really shows that, if you are interested, you can create something which is playable and well-liked.
But beware- Active game development is a daunting task! Be sure you are willing to do some programming and maybe
even get on the technical side of things. You also need to listen to, as well as filter criticism brought up by
other people.
